# DanServe
DanServe Web-development project SME

Welcome back, guys. If you have seen my last project "MyPortfolio" created using HTML and CSS.

This is my second project and an important one because I am going to develop a website for my startup company called DanServe using HTML and CSS technology. I am trying to avoid any framework or even javascript for now. (not sure yet if I can build one without JS).
DanServe is an IT solution company. I have 8 years of IT support experience in multiple multinational companies. When I lost my job, I took up this freelance IT infrastructure upgrade task for a dental clinic. That's when the idea was born. The focus area of DanServe is Small to Medium-scale Enterprises. 

The development project is divided into multiple stages:

1. Logo and tagline - Completed (refer: Images).
2. Schematic flowchart phase- 1 completed (refer: FlowChart1_ver1.pdf).
3. HTML code - Yet to start.
4. CSS code - Can not start.
5. Danserve Domain successfully registered. www.danserve.dk (bought from one.com)
6. Company registration with tax authorities - working on it.
7. Office/facility - will begin working from home.
8. Focus area of DanServe:Â 
      a. IT support (24X7).
      b. IT Infrastructure Upgrade/ building from scratch.
      c. Hardware/Software procurement.
      d. Web-development and deployment ( Partners welcome).
      e. Ethernet Network cabling.
      f. CCTV camera installation.

So far so good...

Keep you posted on all the updates here.

Thanks and regards,
Bash
